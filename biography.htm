			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>My name is <b>Wells Lucas Santo</b>, and I am currently a graduate student at the <a href="http://engineering.nyu.edu" target="_blank">NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering</a> studying Computer Science with a specialization in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I also received my undergraduate degree at NYU Poly in Computer Engineering with a specialization in analog transistor design and computer architecture. Despite this technical background, my true passion lies in the field of philosophy, and I plan to eventually pursue a doctorate degree in neurophilosophy or philosophy of mind.</p>
			<p>Currently, I am also a teacher and educational coach at Five Points Learning, a teaching center based out of Brooklyn, NY. I primarily teach SHSAT and SAT prep courses for both math and writing during the year, but I also have created and taught summer courses such as Pre-Calculus and Programming in C++ to name a few. I also have recently started a programming internship at BT Trading on Wall St. in Manhattan, NY, where I primarily work with nodeJS and WebSocket. In my spare time, I like to work on music composition and production, with the bass guitar as my primary instrument of choice.</p>

			<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
			<p>My writing has garnered a modest amount of attention, most notably with my Editor's Choice essay publication in the 2012-2013 edition of NYU's <i>Mercer Street</i>, which is a yearly publication of student expository essays. I also received a writing award from NYU Polytechnic's Department of Technology, Culture, and Society in 2014 for my short essay on the philosophy of quantum mechanics. Excerpts from both of these essays can be found in the <a href="?page=writings" target="_blank">selected writings section</a> of this site. In my personal time, I write informal essays and reflections, most of which I post to my <a href="http://profoundlyempty.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Tumblr</a> page. I also self-published a collection of short stories in 2012, which is no longer available for purchase. If I fall into the good graces of time and fate, I plan on self-publishing more of my writings in the future.</p>

			<h2 id="teaching">Teaching</h2>
			<p>In March 2012, I received the opportunity of a lifetime by being hired by <a href="http://fivepointslearning.com" target="_blank">Five Points Learning</a>, a teaching company in Brooklyn, NY. Since then, I have taught, tutored, and coached hundreds students from elementary school all the way up to college in a decent variety of topics, ranging from Calculus to Web Programming to SHSAT Verbal Preparation. I have also served as a Teacher's Assistant at NYU Polytechnic in <a href="http://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/course/CS2134" target="_blank">CS2134</a> (Data Structures and Algorithms) for two semesters and <a href="http://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/course/CS1122" target="_blank">CS1122</a> (Introduction to Computer Science) for one semester. Prior to these experience in college, I was also the Co-President of both my high school Philosophy and Web Development clubs, where I prepared and presented weekly lessons and discussions for fellow students. I hope to one day continue my pursuit of teaching to the collegiate level.</p>

			<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
			<p>For the past two summers, I have participated in the Summer Research Program at NYU Polytechnic. In 2013, I worked in the Department of Technology, Management, and Innovation under <a href="http://faculty.poly.edu/~onov/odednov" target="_blank">Professor Oded Nov</a> pursuing topics in Human-Computer Interaction. In 2014, I worked in the Department of Technology, Culture, and Society under <a href="http://ls.poly.edu/~jbain/" target="_blank">Professor Jonathan Bain</a> pursuing topics in Philosophy of Science. Over this past year, I have been positioning myself to begin research with <a href="http://www.tneuro.com/jviventi" target="_blank">Professor Jonathan Viventi</a> in the Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering at NYU in his Translational Neuroengineering Lab.</p>

			<h2>Music</h2>
			<p>From 2010-2012, I was the bassist and secondary vocalist for the alternative rock band, <i>Seventh Day Breakdown</i>. During that time, I also began to learn Classical Music Theory under the instruction of Mr. Jon Fey, which I have applied to short compositions and arrangements since then. Before releasing the full-length album "Memorandom" with my band, I was also the bassist of a jazz ensemble at Monta Vista High School. Recently, I have regrettably been too busy with school and work to pursue my musical interests, although I hope to eventually pursue music composition and production.</p>
