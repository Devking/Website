			<h2 id="flux">&Phi; (Flux)</h2>
			<h3>From Mercer Street 2013 Editor's Choice essay "&Phi; (Flux)", a <i>re-visioning</i> of Anne Carson's <i>Eros: The Bittersweet</i>:</h3>
			<p>"Just as she gives eros motion by describing it as the action of lacking rather than the object of lack itself, she gives motion to ancient Greek and Latin. She shows that history isn’t something that has already happened—it is something that is constantly happening and <i>re</i>-happening. What makes Anne Carson absolutely important to us in the modern world is the fact that she translates and transforms things that we see as static and unchanging into things that continue to move, grow, and evolve."</p>
			<p>"The definition of love is not something that can be pinpointed and captured, and there is never a point in her essays when her chase after the meaning of love seems to stop or stall. But the meaning of love does not merely spin. In the field of physics, there are two types of motion: rotational and translational (Giancoli 249). Rotation describes things that pivot in place. Translation allows for movement—it creates space through displacement, and this is what Anne Carson does with her own act of translation. She reminds us that the ephemeral moment of the chase is what matters, and that we must be forever concerned with the impertinence of existence and the transient nature of all things, especially history, life, and love."</p>

			<h2 id="embedded">Basic Audio Synthesizer</h2>
			<h3>The final report of my Embedded Systems project, which implemented an audio synthesizer using the STM32F4 Discovery Board, written in LaTeX.</h3>
			<p>"In order to have a hands-on appreciation for the diverse practical applications that embedded systems may have, this project was performed in order to program a simple audio synthesizer using the STM32F4 Discovery Board, which would take user input from a computer using the PuTTY console and create audio output using the Discovery Board's on-board DAC. One of the primary objectives in completing this project was allowing for a faithful, <i>real-time</i> production of audio based on what the user expects to hear. This means that as opposed to a project where audio data is stored and then played, the difficulties of this project would be centered around the goal of outputting audio almost immediately and without output distortion. After much consideration and empirical testing, this goal was reached, allowing for a robust synthesizer that would be able to differentiate single key-presses from a key held down for a continuous duration, all while outputting non-distorted audio through the speaker jack of the Discovery Board. This project would also take into consideration different aspects of audio acoustics, including design choices for which audio frequencies to output, what the clock frequency would have to be to faithfully produce those audio frequencies, the audio duration of single key-presses, and how quickly a user is expected to play different notes in succession. These design considerations, along with the process of implementing the project, are described in detail over the length of this report."</p>

			<h2 id="schrodinger">A Re-Evaluation of Schrodinger's "Cat Paradox"</h2>
			<h3>From NYU TCS Department 2014 Humanities Award essay "A Re-Evaluation of Schrodinger's 'Cat Paradox'" on the topic of philosophy of quantum mechanics:</h3>
			<p>"Let us say that I flip a fair coin and immediately cup my hand over it such that I do not observe which side it has landed on. Because I have not yet measured the outcome of the flip, I am <i>epistemically</i> uncertain whether the coin has landed heads or tails. Like with the aliveness of Schrodinger’s Cat, there is a 50-50 chance that either event has occurred. When I take my hand off the coin, I am then able to see which of the two outcomes has actually happened. However, with the flipping of the coin, I can be certain that the coin definitely landed on either heads or tails before I looked at it. In this case, my measurement did not cause the coin to become either heads or tails. With a literal QM interpretation, I cannot be so certain that this holds true for the aliveness of Schrodinger’s Cat, for the state of the cat is in a superposition—an <i>ontological</i> uncertainty."</p>

			<p>"In addition, I must ask when exactly this phenomenon of world splitting occurs. If we believe that world splitting semantically replaces the phenomenon of a measurement, then we still run into all of the same problems as before. For instance, at which point in time during the Schrodinger’s Cat experiment does the world split? Splitting cannot occur right when we close the steel chamber with the cat inside, for we could simply open the chamber back up and save the cat before any radioactive atoms have the chance to decay. Similarly, splitting cannot only occur when we open up the steel chamber to check on the cat, because that would still leave the cat in a “blurred reality” prior to “checking on the cat” just as the Measurement Problem did. In conclusion, it seems that trying to pinpoint the time when a world splits is quite similar a task as trying to define when a measurement occurs, and perhaps the Many Worlds interpretation as commonly understood is not enough to address the Cat Paradox."</p>

			<h2 id="philosophy">What is Philosophy?</h2>
			<h3>A draft from my upcoming collection of essays, <i>fear, impermanence</i>, on the definition and role of philosophy.</h3>
			<p>"My own personal stance, however, is that philosophy is <i>not any one field of study, but the self-reflective starting point for all of them</i>. It is only when a group of topics has become sufficiently systematized with a certain set of procedures and traditions that they may form their own subject field. Questions about the validity of these procedures is retained within philosophy, which merely “grand-fathers” or looks over all other subjects. Attempts at defining philosophy and the procedures of philosophy are merely a testament to the subject looking back upon itself and working to better systematize future fields of study. And yet, that seems slightly inaccurate. Though I whole-heartedly believe that philosophy is crucial to the analyses of current subjects and to the development of future subjects, I believe that it is not an <i>object</i> which moves the world, but the very <i>action of motion and reflection</i> itself. Whereas other fields of study are indeed structured (and somewhat malleable) <i>objects</i> that can be characterized and demarcated, philosophy is the very <i>molding</i> of these fields over time. Thus, it is important to note that a philosopher’s task is that of <i>doing philosophy</i>--in other words, of <i>assisting</i> in the process of systematizing current and future fields of study. Philosophy is the action of asking about the tools and motivations of the things we study. It is not a pursuit of absolute and objective <i>truth</i>, but rather for <i>application</i> of present-day necessities. When the pre-Socratics pondered about the foundations of the universe, they were participating in an activity to help systematize what we now know as cosmology and chemistry. When Locke and Hume commented on the state of the human mind, they were laying the foundations for deeper explorations in phrenology, and later, neuroscience. When we ask questions of consciousness and knowledge today, our ideas shape the foundation of future research in artificial intelligence (and to a certain degree, transhumanism). Thomas Nagel’s latest book, <i>Mind and Cosmos</i>, for instance, is a good example of <i>doing philosophy</i> by positing the need for some new field of study beyond science and religion that incorporates both evidence about the material world and the possible existence of qualities of mind. </p>
			<p>"Make no mistake that this sort of definition of philosophy sounds quite <i>normative</i>. I agree that some thinkers would reject this definition of philosophy, citing some fantastical purpose for their work in philosophy. However, I see no purpose in doing philosophy if it is not at the end a normative endeavor--if what we are doing is helping shape the practices and motivations of fields of study, then what value would it be to posit a solution that does not influence anyone to change how they work? In giving a more refined (or updated) set of tools for the engineers of the mind, do we not expect them to use these tools? Frankly I do not see the use of a philosophy that does not contribute to (or challenge) how we do other fields of study such as mathematics, neuroscience, literary analysis, or engineering as a whole."
