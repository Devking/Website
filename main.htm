			<h1>Hello There!</h1>
			<p>This is my personal website. I do wish to warn you that <b>this site is text heavy</b>. I've decided to stay away from fancy graphics and just stick to a flat, minimal design that emphasizes writing.</p>

			<p>By the way, I coded this site entirely on a text editor, and don't use code or frameworks from anyone else! <b>Go ahead and resize the window horizontally</b> (if you're on a full browser) and see how responsive the page is!</p>

			<p>I am still working on further expanding or redesigning this website. A few of my more graphically-inclined friends highly suggest that I <i>say less and show more.</i> While this may be true, it really wouldn't reflect who I am that much. In this society when '140 characters' is the limit, I really feel like we're missing out on the joy of <i>really</i> reading. For that reason, I've purposely padded these pages with a bit more content than one would usually find on a programmer or designer's personal webpage. Still, I hope to figure out a clever and more aesthetically pleasing way to present and emphasize all this text. <i>The quest continues...</i></p>

			<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
			<p>I am currently a student at <b>NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering</b>, pursuing a Dual-Degree in <i>Computer Science</i> (Master's) and <i>Computer and Electrical Engineering</i> (Bachelor's). I also minor in <i>Philosophy of Science</i>.</p>

			<p>My primary specialization is in <b>Neuro-Cognitive Engineering</b>, or more specifically, on topics of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Brain-Machine Interface. My undergraduate work was primarily in computer architecture, parallel processing, and analog electronic design, leading up to work with bioelectrics.</p>

			<p>Furthermore, I am independently researching topics on <b>Neurophilosophy</b> and Organic Computing. By studying advances in neuroscience and engineering, I hope to reimagine arguments in philosophy of mind, including topics on knowledge representation, identity, consciousness, and mind-body dualism. On the side, I also enjoy working on topics of existentialism and philosophy of science. I strongly believe in the need for a deeper synthesis between the sciences and the humanities.</p>
